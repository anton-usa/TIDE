# TIDE Help

## About
TIDE \(Tkinter Integrated Development Environment) was inspired by IDLE, python's "official" IDE. It follows the principle of strictly using *only* standard python packages. This means the `tkinter` module is used to build the GUI of the IDE.

TIDE is still in active development and will be coming with more features soon. Currently, an integrated shell is currently in the works, with plans to eventually add a debugger as well.

## How To Run
If you've discovered this `README.md`, but haven't yet discovered how to open the program, this is for you. First, install Python from [python.org](https://python.org/download), then run the file `tide` \(for Linux users) or `tide.bat` \(for Windows users)

Running the command `pip install ttkthemes` will add more system themes that are available through this package. If that doesn't work, try running `py -m pip install ttkthemes` for Windows, or `python3 -m pip install ttkthemes` for Mac and Linux

## Plugins
### Default plugins
The IDE does come with some default plugins, they are:

* Bracket Match
* Word Completion (Ctrl+Space)
* File Browser
* And more!

You can read their `README.md` files to know how to use them


### How to create a plugin
Your plugin must have these 3 files:
* \_\_init\_\_.py
* manifest.json
* README.md

**These files must be put in a .zip archive to be installable**

The `__init__.py` file must contain these 3 functions:
* start([window])
	This function is executed when the IDE starts
	or is enabled
* main([window])
	This function is executed when the user
	manually runs it in the plugins menu
* end([window])
	This function is executed when the plugin is
	disabled or uninstalled

The `manifest.json` file must contain have:
* "name": "[The name of the plugin]"
	This is the name of the plugin that will be
	displayed to the user
	
* "description": "[Description of the plugin]"
	This is a small description of the plugin that
	will be displayed to the user
	
* "menu": [boolean]
	will add the plugin to the "Run Plugin" menu
	if set to true

* "disabled": [boolean]
	will disable the plugin if set to true

The `manifest.json` file may also contain:
* "img": "[path to image file]"
	An icon that will be shown to the user in the
	plugins window. Only .gif and .png allowed.
	Please use a 48px Ã— 48px image for best display
	**Note:** .png isn't supported by Tk version older
			  than 8.6

* "shortcut": "[shortcut text]"
	Will display a keyboard shortcut text in the
	"Run Plugin" menu if the plugin is added there
	**The shortcut must be implemented by you**

The `README.md` file is shown in this help menu. It doesn't have to contain anything, but if you want the user to know how to use the plugin, it is encouraged to place all instructions in this file
